# Update-CSS-using-JS

Today I have made a small project of updating CSS by using Javascript. The functionalities here I used are:
1. how to blur an image
2. how to add spacing around an image
3. how to add different colors around an image. 
All of these CSS properties are updated based on Javascript.

Here I followed webos tutorials.
